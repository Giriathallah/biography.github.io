            <b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off
            due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
            school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
            pest-resistent plants.

            on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
            applied science.

            pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
            different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
            varieties for each major climate on Earth.

            <b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
            high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
            to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li class="li-timeline">
            <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of
            wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass

            <b>2005</b>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by
            2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
            crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
            modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
            it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
